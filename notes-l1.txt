Components of a C program

1. Preprocessor Commands: #include and #define that 
tell the compiler to do initial setup.

2. Functions: Blocks of code designed to do a particular
task. Every program has at least one function called 
main().

3. Variables: Named memory locations to store values

4. Statement & Expressions: The logic of the code.

5. Comments: For code readability, ignored by the computer.
